## Unconstrained

First attempt at the unconstrained controller

![unconstrained version 1](/docs/Figure_1_attempt_1_unconstrained.png)

Here we can see the unconstrained controller successfully controlling the system. 
The controller itself can be validated as _stabilising_ through checking the spectral radius, to which it returns $SR = 0.8095604134222927\le 1$ hence it is stabilising.
